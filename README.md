IDEs Considered Harmful Talk
============================

> VIM is the shell, and the shell can do anything.

This talk includes three sections:

1. [text-file-manipulation](https://github.com/dapplebeforedawn/ides-considered-harmful-talk/blob/master/text-file-manipulation.markdown):
  A preview into the mind of a UNIX user as the pipline their way to text file nirvana.  This was not an academic excersize.  I had to modify the two files, and after I did I realized how fluently I UNIX'd them.
1. [source-navigation](https://github.com/dapplebeforedawn/ides-considered-harmful-talk/blob/master/source-navigation.markdown):
  Ugh.  You don't need an IDE to do code search.  The neck-beards of yore gave us some pretty amazing tools.
1. [the-wrench](https://github.com/dapplebeforedawn/ides-considered-harmful-talk/blob/master/the-wrench.markdown):
  Again with the neck-beards.  A bash one-liner that can be applied to a whole class of problems.
  
I don't hate IDEs, I just love the shell.
