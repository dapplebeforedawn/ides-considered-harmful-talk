IDEs Considered Harmful Talk
============================

> VIM is the shell, and the shell can do anything.

This talk includes three sections:

1. text-file-manipulation:
  A preview into the mind of a UNIX user as the pipline their way to text file nirvana.  This was not an academic excersize.  I had to modify the two files, and after I did I realized how fluently I UNIX'd them.
1. source-navigation:
  Ugh.  You don't need an IDE to do code search.  The neck-beards of yore gave us some pretty amazing tools.
1. the-wrench:
  Again with the neck-beards.  A bash one-liner that can be applied to a whole class of problems.
  
I don't hate IDEs, I just love the shell.
